## Edushare
This is my first Supabase project, along with being one of my first Next.js projects, so PLEASE DO NOT JUDGE ME TOO HARSHLY if i am doing stuff incorrectly.

I'm trying to make the transition from Firebase to Supabase, and so far I am NOT disapointed! I absolutely LOVE Supabase!

## Starting this project
To use this, set up the .env file with the NEXT_SUPABASE API keys.

## MISC
If you choose to use this for whatever reason, just give me attribution :D
